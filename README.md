## Issues on last install (05.06.2020)

- `brew cask install dash` not working, wrong download link
- `brew cask install jdownload` throws an error claiming that jDownloader requires java to work (but seems to work fine)
- `brew cask install xscope` not working, checksum not matching. Installed via `mas`
- The `nextcloud` account login does not work with the latest client version. Installed an old version manually to get it working.
- `macos.sh` did not run smoothly, it seems to have some option that makes the script execution fail & stop. Should be updated (see todos).
- `brew cask install virtualbox` produces some errors as the installer is not signed. If lucky a accept dialog is shown in `System Preferences > Security & privacy > General`. If not you need to add Oracle to the list of trusted developers:
  1. Boot into recovery mode: Shut down the system and hold `Cmd + R` while booting.
  2. Enter your password in the recover password screen (you might be able to skip this step if your drive is not encrypted).
  3. Open the terminal and enter `spctl kext-consent add VR5E2TV963` (allow the ID for Oracle).
  4. Restart and try installation again.

## Todo

- Add global gitignore
- Handle dotfiles manually instead of via mackup
- Define how to update / sync with other machine / react to changes in the files
- Update macos settings with this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/master/.macos. Ideally compare to fresh install defaults
